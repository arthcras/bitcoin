This is designed to ensure that assets remain under the ownership of users and are never subject to co-mingling, re-hypothecation, misappropriation, or other illicit use by exchange founders or team members. The exchange has paired a number of innovations including an off-chain sequencer with an industry-leading lightning-fast matching engine, on-chain settlement, and a unique multi-party computation (MPC) wallet to ensure that only those parties authorised by a user have access to their funds. This market structure is an industry first and has been built from the ground-up to realise the true promise of efficient, trustless asset trading and ownership. Your keys, your trades, your assets - even in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency.","url":"https://www.cube.exchange/","image":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/markets/images/1519/small/Cube_Wordmark_Vertical_White_With_Black_BG_%282%29.png?1713153820","has_trading_incentive":false,"trust_score":6,"trust_score_rank":95,"trade_volume_24h_btc":817.3472779825871,"trade_volume_24h_btc_normalized":817.3472779825871},{"id":"bitci","name":"Bitci TR","year_established":2018,"country":"Turkey","description":"","url":"https://www.bitci.com.tr/en","image":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/markets/images/450/small/Bitci.jpg?1706864442","has_trading_incentive":false,"trust_score":6,"trust_score_rank":96,"trade_volume_24h_btc":709.6900813314782,"trade_volume_24h_btc_normalized":709.6900813314782},{"id":"thruster-v3","name":"Thruster V3","year_established":null,"country":null,"description":"","url":"https://app.thruster.finance/","image":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/markets/images/1460/small/thrusterfi.jpeg?1709253847","has_trading_incentive":false,"trust_score":6,"trust_score_rank":97,"trade_volume_24h_btc":691.8317606081016,"trade_volume_24h_btc_normalized":691.8317606081016},{"id":"uniswap_v3_optimism","name":"Uniswap V3 (Optimism)","year_established":null,"country":null,"description":"","url":"https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap","image":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/markets/images/725/small/uniswap-v3.png?1706864684","has_trading_incentive":false,"trust_score":6,"trust_score_rank":98,"trade_volume_24h_btc":657.0177154506221,"trade_volume_24h_btc_normalized":657.0177154506221},{"id":"bitcoin_com","name":"FMFW.io","year_established":2019,"country":"Bahamas","description":"The mission of FMFW.io is to empower people from all over the world to trade cryptocurrencies with ease and confidence, from first-time traders to advanced trading professionals.
