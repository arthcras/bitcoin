Maiar Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is the Automated Market Maker (AMM), rearchitecting some of the key elements to build a product that can leverage the entire \r\nperformance of the Elrond architecture, to offer global, near-instant, inexpensive transactions among an expanding suite of assets.\r\n\r\nThe essence of current versions of automated market makers is best expressed through the constant product equation: x * y = k\r\n\r\nBased on it, if a swap pool owns some units of token x and some units of token y, it prices trades so that the quantities of x and y resulting after the trade, when multiplied, are equal to a fixed constant, k.\r\n\r\nBut current AMM performance could be significantly improved by rebuilding them on \r\nvastly more scalable architectures.\r\n\r\nBy reimagining an automated market maker on top of a highly scalable architecture that is high bandwidth, low latency, and inexpensive, the performance of the swap processes can be drastically improved. With significantly better performance, the scope of AMMs can be rapidly expanded, giving birth to new mark","url":"https://maiar.exchange/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/markets/images/741/small/maiar-dex.png?1638433160","has_trading_incentive":false,"trust_score":7,"trust_score_rank":74,"trade_volume_24h_btc":84.35310927664344,"trade_volume_24h_btc_normalized":84.35310927664344},{"id":"bitmex_spot","name":"BitMEX","year_established":null,"country":null,"description":"","url":"https://www.bitmex.com/spot/","image":"https://assets.coingecko.com/markets/images/866/small/bitmex.jpeg?1652794708","has_trading_incentive":false,"trust_score":7,"trust_score_rank":75,"trade_volume_24h_btc":77.11286034213491,"trade_volume_24h_btc_normalized":77.11286034213491},{"id":"coinlist","name":"Coinlist","year_established":2020,"country":"United States","description":"CoinList is where early adopters invest and trade in high quality crypto assets before they land on other exchanges, including Filecoin, Celo, Solana, Nervos, Dfinity, Algorand, and many more.\r\n\r\nCoinList Trade is a fully-featured crypto spot exchange, built on battle-tested infrastructure and backed by some of the biggest names in the space.
