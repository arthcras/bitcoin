Maiar Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is the Automated Market Maker (AMM), rearchitecting some of the key elements to build a product that can leverage the entire \r\nperformance of the Elrond architecture, to offer global, near-instant, inexpensive transactions among an expanding suite of assets.\r\n\r\nThe essence of current versions of automated market makers is best expressed through the constant product equation: x * y = k\r\n\r\nBased on it, if a swap pool owns some units of token x and some units of token y, it prices trades so that the quantities of x and y resulting after the trade, when multiplied, are equal to a fixed constant, k.\r\n\r\nBut current AMM performance could be significantly improved by rebuilding them on \r\nvastly more scalable architectures.\r\n\r\nBy reimagining an automated market maker on top of a highly scalable architecture that is high bandwidth, low latency, and inexpensive, the performance of the swap processes can be drastically improved.
